# Credit-Risk-Database

This was the final project for CS425- Database Organization. In this Project, my team and I had to
design a home lending database for credit risk. the motivation for this project was that 
banks have to loan to potential customers and need a way to keep track of their data like loan forms
or personal information. this helps the bank decide weather to approve the loan.

This project had many deliverables like designing the outline of what data goes into the database,
designing the database schema, normalizing the database, and then making the database. We were then told
to make SQL queries(on fake data) in the database. This was a mix of easy queries, and complex queries that join
dataframes and columns.
